# ESP32-Based Wearable IoT Device with Knitted Antenna  
*(Master’s Thesis Summary)*

This repository provides a high-level summary of my Master’s thesis completed in **Electrical and Microsystems Engineering** at **OTH Regensburg**.

## Project overview
The work focuses on the design and implementation of an **ESP32-based wireless IoT device** integrating a **knitted textile antenna** for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi communication in wearable environments.
## System overview
